==========

Simple command line tool for generating a Dash docset from Javadoc-generated documentation

## Usage

1. Download a compiled binary from http://kapeli.com/javadocset.zip or compile it yourself from source using Xcode.
2. Use it: ```./javadocset <any docset name you want> <path to Javadoc-generated API folder>```

Example usage: ```./javadocset Java api```

Note: I have a compiled version of javadocset tool, it is executable. Just download it and execute in your folder.
